            HTML is really a very simple language. It consists of ordinary text, with commands that are enclosed by
            "&lt;" and "&gt;"" characters, or between an "&amp;" and a ";" (for example: &lt;html&gt;).
            You don&rsquo;t really need to know much HTML to create a page, because you can copy bits of HTML
            from other pages that do what you want, then change the text!
            This page shows on the left as it appears in your browser, and the corresponding HTML code appears on the right.
            The HTML commands are linked to explanations of what they do.

            <b>Line Breaks</b>
        </marquee>
        <p>HTML doesn't normally use line breaks for ordinary text. 
            A white space of any size is treated as a single space.
            The code type of format can also be used in html for example
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="2" face="courier">
                #include &lt;iostream&gt; <br>
                void main() <br>
                { <br>
                    cout &lt;&lt; "This is the simple program"; <br>
                } <br>
            </font>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to put multiple spaces, then you can use non breaking space entity by multiple times.For ex,I would like to use 3 more blank spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here
            If you want to put a line break at a particular place, you can use the &lt;BR&gt; command, or, for a paragraph
             break, the "&lt;p&gt;" command, which will insert a blank line. You can also use some extended text formatting feeatures
             such as superscript,subscript and mark features like this <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            1 <sup>st</sup>, 2 <sub>nd</sub> <mark>mark</mark> and <em>emphasized format features.</em>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p><b>Starting and Stopping Commands</b></p>
        <p>
            <font face="consolas">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Most HTML commands come in pairs: for example, "&lt;H4&gt;" marks the beginning of a size 4 heading,<br>
        and &lt;/H4&gt; marks the end of it. The closing command is always the same as the opening command, except for the addition of<br>
        the "/".
            </font>
        </p>
        <p>
        <font face="courier">
            Modifiers are sometimes included along with the basic command, inside the opening command's &lt; &gt;. The modifier does not need to be repeated in the closing command.
        </font>

        <h1 align="middle">This is a size "1" heading</h1>
        <h2>This is a size "2" heading</h2>
        <h3 align="right">This is a size "3" heading</h3>
